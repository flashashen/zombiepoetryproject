##TODO##

- fix db password sync. dockerfile start.sh generates this so backup and restore can't cross containers presently
- Dockerfile won't build. Could move to officail nginx and separate mysql
- lots of hard urls/links exist so can't install site on another server. 
- add vagrant/docker test of ansible scripts
