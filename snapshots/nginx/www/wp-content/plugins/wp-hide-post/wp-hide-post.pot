#. Description of an extension
msgid ""
"Enables a user to control the visibility of items on the blog by making "
"posts and pages selectively hidden in different views throughout the blog, "
"such as on the front page, category pages, search results, etc... The hidden "
"item remains otherwise accessible directly using permalinks, and also "
"visible to search engines as part of the sitemap (at least). This plugin "
"enables new SEO possibilities for authors since it enables them to create "
"new posts and pages without being forced to display them on their front and "
"in feeds."
