== About Semper Fi ==

	Dedicate to my Grandfather's Bravery in WWII, Semper Fi has a high quality newspaper feeling to it. From hidden luxurious floral patterns, to images that create the nostalgia of finely crafted paper, incredibly detailed shadowing, but most importantly, Semper Fi has the ability to respond to any width screen. From 300 pixels wide, all the way to 1920 and beyond, images, galleries, quotes, text, and titles all move fluidly to respond to any thing you through at it. (More Updates to come soon)

== Installing Semper Fi Manually (FTP) ==

	To add a Semper Fi to your WordPress installation, follow these basic steps:

		1. Download the Semper Fi archive and extract the files it contains. You need to preserve the directory structure in the archive when extracting these files. Using an FTP client to access your host web server, create a directory to save Semper Fi in the wp-content/themes directory provided by WordPress. For example: wp-content/themes/semperfi
    
		2. Upload the Semper Fi files to the new directory on your host server.

== Permium Features on Semper Fi ==

	Semper Fi is considered an "Up-Vert Theme," meaning that it is first and foremost a completely free theme, but with that said some of the additional features remain unusable until you purchase the theme. I currently charge a one-time fee for unlimited access to free updates and downloads forever. It is simple, clean, and easy to "Active" your theme for life. Purchase "Semper Fi" by going to the http address http://schwarttzy.com/shop/semper-fi/ and add SemperFi to the cart and checkout normally. Once you have successful purchased the theme, look for an Email that is from "Schwarttzy.com," not from PayPal, and in that email is Transaction Code, copy and paste the Transaction Code in the Activation field below and you'll have completed everything you need to do.
