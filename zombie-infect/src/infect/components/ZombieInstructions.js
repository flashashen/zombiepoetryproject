                        poem.

                    <li>The project <strong>preserves prior iterations</strong> of the zombie process. To <strong>cycle through zombifications</strong> of a selected clause, <strong>use the arrow keys</strong> on your keyboard.</li>

                        colons, and em-dashes, work best.</strong> Very short sentences and long sentences without
                        sentence terminals may require several re-zombifications, but thatâ€™s part of the fun.
